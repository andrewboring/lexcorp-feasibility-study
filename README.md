Feasibility Study of Lex Luthor's Plan in Superman (1978)  
This data project is a feasibility study to analyze costs needed to implement LexCorp's plan.   

Executive Summary
The San Andreas Fault is a right-lateral strike-slip fault forming the boundary of the Pacific and North American plates. The Pacific plate is moving toward a north-west direction, while the North American plate is moving south-west. The fault runs predominately northwest to southeast through the State of California, and runs along major metropolitan areas such as San Franciso and the Silicon Valley area, Parkfield, and then turns slightly more westward away from Los Angeles and into Palm Springs (see map).

The strategic initiative of LexCorp is to purchase parcels of land directly east of the San Andreas Fault, and then force a tectonic event (through a nuclear warhead exploded directly on the faultline) so that land on the Pacific plate moves away from the North American plate, or otherwise shifts to create new oceanfront property along the fault line.

The previously landlocked property will significantly increase in value, providing significant real estate control over California through monopoly of land ownership. This land can then be rented/leased or sold providing significant revenue for future LexCorp operations.
