# Feasibility Study of Lex Luthor's Plan in Superman (1978)  
This data project is a feasibility study to analyze costs needed to implement the plan, and recommend a financial strategy for execution.   

**Project Phase**: Proposal  
**Status**: In-progress  


## Executive Summary

The San Andreas Fault is a right-lateral strike-slip fault forming the boundary of the Pacific and North American plates. The Pacific plate is moving in a north-west direction, while the North American plate is moving south-west. The fault runs predominately northwest to southeast through the State of California, and runs along major metropolitan areas such as San Franciso and the Silicon Valley area, Parkfield, and then turns slightly more westward away from Los Angeles and into Palm Springs (see map).

The strategic initiative of LexCorp is to purchase parcels of land directly east of the San Andreas Fault, and then force a tectonic event (through a nuclear warhead exploded directly on the faultline) to force soil liquification west of the faultline, creating valuable new ocean-front property owned by LexCorp.

The previously landlocked property will significantly increase in value, providing significant real estate control over California through monopoly of land ownership. This land can then be rented/leased or sold providing significant revenue for future LexCorp operations. 

The purpose of this study is to determine which parcels of land (by zip code) to purchase along the fault, the initial cost of the acquisitions, and the order of such acquisitions (by property value and expected post-event ROI).

## Data Sources

Potential sources of data include:
* US Geological Survey (fault information)
* Zillow (real estate market prices)
* US Government Open Data service
* California Open Data service

## Outline of Procedure

1. Obtain/generate list of zipcodes east of the San Andreas fault
2. Obtain residential home sale prices (current and historical)
3. Create rank-ordered list and purchase plan.
4. Outline high-level budgetary cost for project (based on current market value)
5. Outline high-level expected margin (based on expected sale/rental prices)
